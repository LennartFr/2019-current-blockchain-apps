# Programming Hyperledger

[Writing Smart Contracts in NodeJS:](https://github.com/LennartFr/fabcar-blockchain-sample/tree/master/contract/lib/fabcar.js)

This repo consists of a number of IBM code patterns focused on Hyperledger Fabric and IBM Blockchain.

They are being used for two-hour coding events using a chart deck provided outside of this repo.

Before the start of the coding event, the participants are encouraged to install the pre-requisites that are listed at the beginning of each exercise. Please note that MacBook and Ubuntu are the easiest operating systems to use.

For a 2-hour workshop the second, third and fourth exercises should be focused on. While the fifth, six and seventh can also be used for longer workshops.
